This was my first project using a number of techniques:

- Mortise and tenon

- Edge joining without dowels

- Epoxy

- Miter joints

It came out VERY well, all things considered. Nearly perfectly square!

# Lessons Learned

## Materials

- Reclaimed/old growth cedar is amazing to work with.

## Measuring and Cutting

- For all final cuts/planes, sneak up on them as you get closer to the final
  stage instead of cutting/planing to the exact size you need at the
  outset. This gives you some nice buffer to work with when things go wrong
  unexpectedly.

- Cutting mortises with a router is *really* hard to get exactly right, which
  you need to to get things to line up exactly. You really need a dedicated jig
  for this joint.

- Cutting tenonas with a router is hard, but somewhat easier than cutting
  mortises. But again, to get things to line up perfectly, you need absolute
  precision, and I don't have that/pretty sure you need a jig for this too t3o
  get it.

- Don't cut 45 degree miter cross cuts using a beveled blade angle--unless it is
  *exactly* 45, things won't line up. Instead, use a sled/miter guage set at 45
  degrees and a vertically aligned blade--works *much* better.

- Miter cuts for cross-supports like in this project are hard to guage in terms
  of how long something needs to be; sneaking up on the final cut is absolutely
  essentialy.

# Staining

- The General Finishers' stain I tried from Rockler was much more finicky than
  the "regular" stains I get from Menards; not sure the final color/look was any
  better either. Probably will just go with the Menards brand in the future.

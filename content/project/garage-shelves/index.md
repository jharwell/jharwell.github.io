In this project, I utilized my new Kreg ripcut jig, which made cutting long,
perfectly straight lines in sheet goods ridiculously easy. I followed the
general design from [here](https://dadand.com/diy-2x4-shelving/), decreasing the
overall shelf depth to fit along the extra space on the side of my
garage. Different from the workbench, I used OSB for the shelves.

# Lessons Learned

## Measuring and Cutting

- Make sure to account for the width of the shelf horizontal 2x4 supports when
  measuring for the depth of the shelf. I didn't, so my shelves are 1" short in
  the back, and only cover the first 1/2" of the 2x4 support. It's not a big
  deal, because the shelves are still well supported and anchored, but it is an
  aesthetic faux pas.h

- A multi-tool is invaluable for getting perfectly square notches in sheet
  goods: 98% of the notches are cut with a circular saw, and the nice corner
  finished with the multi-tool with a standard wood blade.

- Sanding OSB is more difficult than plywood to sand, because a some of the
  little bits of wood come off and get stuck in the orbital sander.

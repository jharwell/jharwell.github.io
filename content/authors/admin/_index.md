Dr. Harwell is a post-doctal researcher specializing in theoretical swarm
robotics. His PhD thesis developed new theoretical tools for measuring,
modeling, controlling, and (critically) predicting the behavior of bio-inspired
multi-agent systems from small (≤ 5 agents) to large (≥ 10, 000 agents) scales,
and targeted applications to foraging and construction tasks in dynamic,
dangerous, and unknown environments.

His research interests lie in the investigation of behavior in interacting
multi-agent systems, at the intersection of task allocation, mathematical
modeling, complexity theory, robotics, and swarm intelligence. He is interested
in the following broad areas:

1. Understanding the fundamental principles of large systems, including the
   “unpredictable” behaviors which emerge as systems interact with their
   environments in non-trivial ways, to develop better models of collective
   behavior.  Developing mathematical models for predictive control of
   large-scale multi-agent systems from first principles which are robust enough
   to cross the simulation-reality gap. Of particular interest are applications
   in dangerous or unstable environments (e.g., mining, space exploration), or
   dynamic environments (i.e., those which are modified by the swarm as it
   operates), such as agriculture, autonomous construction, debris/waste
   removal.

2. In addition to theoretical swarm robotics, Dr. Harwell is also interested in
   bringing elements of software engineering into research in order to
   accelerate research progress and reproducibility through automation. He has
   authored several tools and frameworks towards this goal, including:

    - **LIBRA** (**L**uig**I** **B**uild **R**eusable **A**utomation). A handy
      cmake automation framework for devops tasks for C/C++ projects. See the
      project or docs pages for more details.

    - **SIERRA** (re**S**earch p**I**pelin**E** for **E**eusability,
      **R**eproducibility, and **A**utomation. Plugin-based tool that makes it
      easy to investigate research questions like "How will system behavior
      change if I vary X between 1 and 10?". Targets robotics and multi-agent
      systems, handling low-level engineering details such as execution
      environment and platform (arbitrary simulator, real robots, etc.)
      configuration. See the project or docs pages for more details.

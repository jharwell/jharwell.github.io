 abstract = {Swarm robotics (SR) offers promising solutions to real-world problems that can be modeled as
foraging tasks, e.g. disaster/trash cleanup or object gathering for construction. Yet current SR
foraging approaches make limiting assumptions that restrict their applicability to selected
real-world environments. We propose an improved self-organized task allocation method based on
task partitioning that removes restrictions such as: (1) \empha priori knowledge of foraging
environment, and (2) strict limitations on intermediate drop/pickup site behavior. With
experiments in simulation, we show that under the proposed constraint relaxation, our approach
still provides performance increases when compared to an unpartitioned strategy within some
combinations of swarm sizes, robot capabilities, and environmental conditions.  This work
broadens the applicability of SR foraging approaches, showing that they can be effective under
ideal conditions while continuing to perform robustly in more volatile/challenging environments.},

In this project, I followed the general design from
[here](https://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/wood-closet-shelving),
with the crucial difference being that because I wanted to use "solid" shelves
instead of individual 1x4s, it was a much more involved project. I learned the
value of a good jointing jig (which I bought), generally how to join 1x4 boards
edgewise so that the finished "sheet" is pretty much indistinguishable from a
single solid board.

# Lessons Learned

## Materials

- When selecting materials to be used in edge-joined shelves, pick boards of the
  same thickness. I picked a mix of yellow and white pine boards which were
  about 1/16" - 1/8" different in thickness, which resulted in a LOT of extra
  sanding.

## Building

- Don't skimp on a jointing jig. I spent $70 on mine, and it was absolutely
  worth it--I got *perfectly* aligned boards every time.

- Don't rush joining: only ever join 1 edge at a time; that is, don't try to
  join together 4 1x4s edgewise simultaneously. When you do that, the final
  product is much more likely to bow/smile if the edges aren't perfectly 90
  degrees. If you only add one new board at a time to a joint, it is much easier
  to clamp everything together tightly enough so that even if the edge angles
  aren't 90 degrees, the final produce doesn't bow.

- If you are using every one of your clamps simultaneously, you don't have "just
  enough" clamps--you don't have ENOUGH clamps.

- Sand long boards to finish on the faces before you cut them into e.g., 12"
  chunks. MUCH easier to sand that way than to sand the smaller pieces.

- If you want to have a piece be EXACTLY say 12" after both ends are finish
  sanded, you can't cut it to EXACTLY 12" with the saw. That is, when you make
  your mark/draw a line, it needs to be > 12". Probably about 1/32" -
  1/16". This results in all boards being a good bit longer than they need to
  be, but they can they all be sanded to EXACTLY the desired length.

- When marking lines for cutting, don't use a mechanical pencil--lines are too
  thin. Instead, use a sharp carpenter pencil, and always "keep" the line when
  making the cut; the width of the line should be 1/32" - 1/16", which if the
  line is drawn on the "keep" side of the board at EXACTLY e.g. 12", then this
  will result in the right amount of extra material so the finished material is
  exactly the length you want.

- Sanding is like 90% of the total time for an indoor/finish carpentry
  project. As a result, investing in a really nice sander is much more important
  than investing in a really nice circular saw. Using the cordless RYOBI sander
  was a terrible idea--the sander you use for this should absolutely be corded.
  Corded sanders are more powerful, and you don't have to worry about having to
  stop and wait for a battery to recharge. If you have LOTS of spare batteries,
  then the waiting is not an issue, but the lack of power compared to corded
  sanders still is.

- Dust collection with a vaccuum/dust collector is pretty much required when
  doing extensive amounts of sanding. I didn't have this, so *everything* in the
  garage ended up covered in a thick layer of dust.

- When sanding the outer edges of joined boards for shelves, you have to be
  *very* careful to keep things square by going back and forth across the whole
  edge slowly and carefully. I didn't do this, and ended up with shelves which
  were very subtley not square, and were in fact parallelograms.

- 150 grit sandpaper is the minimum grit for finish carpentry.

- When sanding, swirl marks might only appear once staining is done, so you need
  to be careful to:

  - Never set the sander down on the piece while the disk in in motion

  - Don't push hard when sanding.

  I ignored both of these and ended up with some avoidable swirl marks. There
  were also a bunch of marks that were just from the sanding pad of the RYOBI
  sander I was using which could have been avoided if I had used a new sanding
  pad.

- When you are going to have to assemble something in place, add some extra
  padding/space to however large you think you can make something and have it
  still fit in the space. I got VERY lucky here, as I was juuusssttt able to get
  the shelves into the closet diagonally.

## Staining

- Do a "dry fit" for projects like this freestanding--before staining. I
  waited to do that until after staining, so I had to take apart/put the shelves
  back together an additional time AND do a bunch of touch up staining.

- Do staining outside whenever possible--certainly NOT in the dusty space you've
  been sanding in.

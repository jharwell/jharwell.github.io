abstract: "Modern intelligent systems researchers employ the scientific method: they form
  hypotheses about system behavior, and then run experiments using one or more
  independent variables to test their hypotheses.  We present SIERRA, a novel
  framework structured around that idea for accelerating research developments
  and improving reproducibility of results. SIERRA makes it easy to quickly
  specify the independent variable(s) for an experiment, generate experimental
  inputs, automatically run the experiment, and process the results to generate
  deliverables such as graphs and videos. SIERRA provides reproducible
  automation independent of the execution environment (HPC hardware, real
  robots, etc.) and targeted platform (arbitrary simulator or real robots),
  enabling exact experiment replication (up to the limit of the execution
  environment and platform). It employs a deeply modular approach that allows
  easy customization and extension of automation for the needs of individual
  researchers, thereby eliminating manual experiment configuration and result
  processing via throw-away scripts."

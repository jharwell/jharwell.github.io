I am a recent PhD graduate at the University of Minnesota, and member of the
Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Vision Laboratory at the University of
Minnesota, under the direction of Dr. Maria Gini, my advisor. My research
interests lie broadly in the investigation of emergent behavior in large
interacting multi-agent systems, at the intersection of task allocation,
mathematical modeling, swarm robotics, and swarm intelligence.  I'm interested
in two main areas:

- Understanding the fundamental principles of large swarms, including the
  "unpredictable" behaviors which emerge as such complex systems interact with
  their environments in non-trivial ways, to develop better models of collective
  behavior.

- Developing mathematical models for predictive control of large-scale
  multi-agent robotic systems from first principles which are robust enough to
  cross the simulation-reality gap.  Of particular interest are applications in
  dangerous or unstable environments (e.g., mining, space exploration), or
  dynamic environments (i.e., those which are modified by the swarm as it
  operates), such as agriculture, autonomous construction, debris/waste
  removal.

My areas of expertise include: swarm intelligence, swarm robotics, mathematical
modeling of multi-agent systems, algorithm design, data structures, software
engineering, real-time embedded systems, and high performance computing.

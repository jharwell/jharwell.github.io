abstract: 'When designing swarm-robotic systems, systematic
comparison of swarm control algorithms is necessary to de-
termine which can scale up to handle the target problem size
and operating conditions. Qualitative predictions of performance
based on algorithm descriptions are often incorrect, and can
lead to costly design processes for swarm-robotic systems. We
propose a set of quantitative measures for swarm scalability,
emergence, flexibility, and robustness which enable swarm control
algorithms analysis and comparison, swarm performance of a
given control algorithm, collectively enabling quicker and more
confident design decisions. We demonstrate the utility of our
proposed measurements as modeling and design tools for real-
world scenarios by analyzing two common problems, indoor
warehouse object transport and search and rescue, and present
experimental results obtained in simulation.'

In this project, I utilized my new Kreg ripcut jig, which made cutting long,
perfectly straight lines in sheet goods ridiculously easy. I followed the
general design from [here](https://dadand.com/diy-2x4-shelving/), decreasing the
overall shelf depth to fit along the extra space on the side of my
garage. Different from the workbench, I used OSB for the shelves.

# Lessons Learned

## Measuring and Cutting

- Make sure to account for the width of the shelf horizontal 2x4 supports when
  measuring for the depth of the shelf. I didn't, so my shelves are 1" short in
  the back, and only cover the first 1/2" of the 2x4 support. It's not a big
  deal, because the shelves are still well supported and anchored, but it is an
  aesthetic faux pas.

- A multi-tool is invaluable for getting perfectly square notches in sheet
  goods: 98% of the notches are cut with a circular saw, and the nice corner
  finished with the multi-tool with a standard wood blade.

- Sanding OSB is more difficult than plywood to sand, because a some of the
  little bits of wood come off and get stuck in the orbital sander.

## Finishing

- When possible, sand and finish everything BEFORE assembly. For many projects,
  doing it after assembly is required, esp. if there is no way to do a "dry fit"
  which can be easily undone before final assembly. But for this project,
  instead of permanently assembling and THEN staining, it would have been much
  easier to stain then assemble. For additional sanding/cutting/etc that I had
  to do, I could have done touch-ups as needed.

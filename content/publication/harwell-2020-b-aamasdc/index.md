abstract: Self-organized task allocation is possible with systems designed using the
  swarm robotic principles of scalability, flexibility, robustness, and emergence.
  We summarize (1) our derived quantitative measurements of these principles in 10,000
  robot swarms, and (2) our task allocation work using stochastic choice and matroids.
  We propose extensions to our current task allocation methodology using stochastic
  processes and graph-theoretic topological invariants to provide a unified algorithmic
  approach to swarm-robotic foraging and construction.

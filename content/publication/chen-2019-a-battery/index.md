abstract: ' Miniaturization and cost, two of the main attractive factors of swarm
  robotics, have motivated its use as a solution in object collecting tasks, search
  & rescue missions, and other applications. However, in the current literature only
  a few papers consider energy allocation efficiency within a swarm. Generally, robots
  recharge to their maximum level every time unconditionally, and do not incorporate
  estimates of the energy needed for their next task. In this paper we present an
  energy efficiency maximization method that minimizes the overall energy cost within
  a swarm while simultaneously maximizing swarm performance on an object gathering
  task. The method utilizes dynamic thresholds for upper and lower battery limits.
  This method has also shown to improve the efficiency of existing energy management
  methods. '

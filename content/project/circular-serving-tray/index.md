This was my first project heavily using the router: The circle for the bottom
and the two rings for the sides were all cut with the router, so there was a LOT
of learning which happened there.

# Lessons Learned

## Jointing

- When face jointing boards, you don't need to sand when they come off the
  planar; clamping alone will give you a nice result. If you sand, you run the
  risk of sanding things near the edges such that there will be gaps in the two
  panels once glued which you cannot clamp shut. Your only option at that point
  is to cut things smaller with the router to get past the affected area(s) near
  the edge.


## Measuring and Cutting

- Using a trim router to cut these pushes the limit of what it can do. There was
  some minor smoking/burning on some of the pine bits which I think might have
  been due to it bogging down.

- Cut your initial circle/thing with a router about 1/2" larger than you want
  the final product to be. Since I was just using a nail+straightedge guide to
  more or less freehand these cuts, there is a non-neglible chance that
  something is going to jerk and ruin  the cut near the edge; this only happens
  on the initial cuts. Such things are easily cleaned up with shallower
  polishing passes.

- A plunge router is the correct tool for this sort of thing; my plunge base
  wasn't compatible with my edge guide, so I didn't use it. I had to "tip" in
  the router while it was on, which is doable but also very error prone.

- Taking multiple passes of no more than 1/4" deep with a 1/4" bit is needed for
  best results with my little Makita trim router.

- A dedicated jig with a immobile arm for the radius of the circles I'm cutting
  (made of wood/metal) would have made this soooo much easier.

# Sanding

- You need a foam pad on your ROS if you are going to use it to sand curves like
  this. The flat plate it comes with just won't work, esp. on the inside
  curve. Doing said curve by hand is really time consuming, and results in a
  subpar finish (granted, this was my first time trying to hand sand something
  like that). Plus, the foam pads are like $10 for a pack of 5, so they are
  cheap, and work pretty well.

# Finishing

- The cedar version of this project could have really benefited from some
  finishing wax, but I didn't have any, so I used butcher block oil/conditioner
  instead.

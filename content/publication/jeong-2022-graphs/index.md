abstract: "The exploration time for a swarm of robots doing object gathering
     depends on the specific task, environment, number of objects, and number of
     robots. Hence, it is important to understand how different properties
     affect the exploration time. To address this practical challenge, we
     present a theoretical analysis of the expected exploration time for a swarm
     of robots that are searching for objects in an arena and present
     experimental results obtained with different swarm sizes. The experimental
     results are consistent with the theoretical analysis."

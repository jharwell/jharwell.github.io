Core Swarm (COSM) is a middleware-esque library providing:

- A Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL): A common API to different platforms
  (ARgoS, ROS, etc) which client applications can write to.

- A Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): A common API to different agent/robot
  types which client applications to write to.

- A collection of reusable algorithms and scaffolding to maximize reuse across
  multi-agent system projects and reduce development time. High level summaries
  of COSMâ€™s main modules providing reusable (but not necessarily generic
  functionality in MAS projects) are below; for full details see the API.

    - Artificial potential fields for navigation and flocking: cosm::apf2D.

    - Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL): cosm::pal.

    - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): cosm::hal.

    - Task allocation. Various methods from the swarm robotics literature, most
      of which do not require communication.

    - Flocking. Also metrics and collectors. cosm::flocking and
      cosm::spatial::strategy::flocking.

    - Common agent subsystems: cosm::subsystem

      - Sensing and Actuation (SAA)

      - Perception

    - Foraging: block distribution, block motion, injection of perfect
      information about blocks and caches. Metrics and
      collectors. cosm::foraging.

    - General kinematics definitions for interfacing with ROS and other
      platforms: cosm::kin.

    - Convergence measurements of different types; metrics and
      collectors. cosm::convergence.

    - Injection of environmental and population dynamics; metrics and
      collectors. cosm::tv.

    - Simple management of arena state via grid: cosm::arena.

abstract: We identify barriers to broader application of multi-robot systems to
  construction and deconstruction tasks, which represent important real-world
  problems such as repair of critical infrastructure of roads and levies after a
  disaster. We frame these tasks as instances of the parallel bricklayer
  problem, where independent agents must coordinate to concurrently manipulate
  aspects of a 3D environment without deadlocks. Extracting desirable properties
  of graphs representing natural 3D structures, we sketch a graphical
  representation to model and reason about structures composed of discrete,
  cuboid blocks.  We present a sample algorithm sketch on a non-trivial
  structure utilizing our model.'

abstract: 'Swarm robotics (SR) offers promising solutions to real-world problems that
  can be modeled as foraging tasks, e.g. disaster/trash cleanup or object gathering
  for construction. Yet current SR foraging approaches make limiting assumptions that
  restrict their applicability to selected real-world environments. We propose an
  improved self-organized task allocation method based on task partitioning that removes
  restrictions such as: (1) empha priori knowledge of foraging environment, and (2)
  strict limitations on intermediate drop/pickup site behavior. With experiments in
  simulation, we show that under the proposed constraint relaxation, our approach
  still provides performance increases when compared to an unpartitioned strategy
  within some combinations of swarm sizes, robot capabilities, and environmental conditions.  This
  work broadens the applicability of SR foraging approaches, showing that they can
  be effective under ideal conditions while continuing to perform robustly in more
  volatile/challenging environments.'

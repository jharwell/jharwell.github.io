 abstract = {Automation in construction is possible with systems designed using the swarm
robotic principles of scalability, flexibility, robustness, and emergence. We
derive quantitative measurements of these principles in 10,000 robot swarms as a
first step in achieving this goal. We summarize our recent task allocation work in
the context of an object gathering task and demonstrate its feasibility in the
context of automated construction tasks. We present a trajectory to extend our
current task allocation methodology using stochastic processes in order to present
a unified approach to task allocation in swarm-robotic construction.},

abstract: "     Localized communication in swarms has been shown to increase swarm\
  \ effectiveness in some situations by allowing for additional opportunities for\
  \ cooperation. However, communication and utilization of potentially outdated information\
  \ is also a concern. We present an explicit non-directional goal-based communication\
  \ model and message accept/reject scheme, and test our model in a set of object\
  \ gathering experiments with a swarm of robots. The results of the experiments indicate\
  \ that even low levels of communication regarding the swarm's goal outperform high\
  \ levels of random information communication. "

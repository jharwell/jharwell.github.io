 abstract = {We present SIERRA, a novel framework for accelerating development and
improving reproducibility of results in robotics research. SIERRA accelerates
research by automating the process of generating experiments from queries over
independent variables(s), executing experiments, and processing the results to
generate deliverables such as graphs and videos. It shifts the paradigm for
testing hypotheses from procedural (``Do these steps to answer the query'') to
declarative (``Here is the query to test---GO!''), reducing the burden on
researchers. It employs a modular architecture enabling easy customization and
extension for the needs of individual researchers, thereby eliminating manual
configuration and processing via throw-away scripts.  SIERRA improves
reproducibility of research by providing automation independent of the
execution environment (HPC hardware, real robots, etc.) and targeted platform
(simulator, real robots, etc.). This enables exact experiment replication, up
to the limit of the execution environment and platform, as well as making it
easy for researchers to test hypotheses in different computational
environments. Though SIERRA is targeted at robotics research, its design makes
it extendable to other fields.},

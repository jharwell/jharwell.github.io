abstract: Automation in construction is possible with systems designed using the swarm
  robotic principles of scalability, flexibility, robustness, and emergence. We derive
  quantitative measurements of these principles in 10,000 robot swarms as a first
  step in achieving this goal. We summarize our recent task allocation work in the
  context of an object gathering task and demonstrate its feasibility in the context
  of automated construction tasks. We present a trajectory to extend our current task
  allocation methodology using stochastic processes in order to present a unified
  approach to task allocation in swarm-robotic construction.

I am a member of the Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Vision Laboratory at
the University of Minnesota, under the direction of Dr. Maria Gini, my
advisor. My research interests lie broadly in the investigation of emergent
behavior in large interacting multi-agent systems, at the intersection of task
allocation, mathematical modeling, swarm robotics, and swarm intelligence.  More
specifically, my research includes developing mathematical models for predictive
control of large-scale multi-agent robotic systems to create programmable robot
swarms for applications such as autonomous construction, mining, and space
exploration.

My areas of expertise include: swarm intelligence, swarm robotics, swarm
emergent behavior, algorithm design, data structures, stochastic modeling,
software engineering, real-time embedded systems, and high performance
computing.

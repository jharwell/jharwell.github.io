This was my first attempt at "finished" woodworking, as these laptop stands
would be for indoor use, and therefore needed to loop better than something
which was passable for the garage.

# Lessons Learned

## Materials

- Use good quality plywood. The higher quality, the better. HOWEVER, don't use
  plywood which has a veneer on it, as it will be prone to breaking when
  glued. I found this out the hard way when working with some really nice
  looking oak veneer plywood which I found by the side of the road and plane the
  stain off of.

## Measuring and Cutting

- Precisely cutting the width of strips at each stage is critical. Even small
  (1/32") deviations add up over time and lead to the chevrons not lining up
  perfectly. Having a thin rip jig makes this a LOT more precise. I'm still not
  perfect, but much closer than before.

- Because the glued slabs are prone to cracking/breaking at every stage, cut
  things about 1/2" larger than you need when doing planing/sanding so that any
  breakages are not fatal.

- Because of the nature of what you're planing (plywood edges), things are still
  fairly rough coming out of the planer, so you MUST leave enough buffer that
  you can sand things down without making the piece too thin. This is especially
  critical for slabs which are ultimately intended to fit into grooves/dados.


# Staining

- This is one project where you have to stain the pieces BEFORE final assembly,
  because it is really tight if you try and stain assembled.

 abstract = {We present a set of metrics intended to supplement designer intuitions when
designing swarm-robotic systems to solve variants of object gathering
problems, increase accuracy in extrapolating swarm behavior from algorithmic
descriptions and small test experiments, and lead to faster and less costly
design cycles. We build on previous works studying self-organizing behaviors
in autonomous systems to derive a metric for swarm emergent self-organization.
We utilize techniques from high performance computing, time series analysis,
and queueing theory to derive metrics for swarm scalability, flexibility to
changing external environments, and robustness to internal system stimuli such
as sensor and actuator noise and robot failures.
We demonstrate the utility of our metrics by analyzing four different control
algorithms in two scenarios: an indoor warehouse object transport scenario
with static objects and a spatially unconstrained outdoor search and rescue
scenario with moving objects. In the spatially constrained warehouse scenario,
efficient use of space is key to success so algorithms that use mechanisms for
traffic regulation and congestion reduction are the most appropriate.  In the
search and rescue scenario, the same will happen with algorithms which can
cope well with object motion through dynamic task allocation and randomized
search trajectories. We show that our intuitions about comparative algorithm
performance are well supported by the quantitative results obtained using our
metrics, and that our metrics can be synergistically used together to predict
collective behaviors based on previous results in some cases.},

abstract: When designing swarm-robotic systems, systematic comparison of algorithms
  from different domains is necessary to determine which is capable of scaling up
  to handle the target problem size and target operating conditions. We propose a
  set of quantitative metrics for scalability, flexibility, and emergence which are
  capable of addressing these needs during the system design process. We demonstrate
  the applicability of our proposed metrics as a design tool by solving a large object
  gathering problem in temporally varying operating conditions using iterative hypothesis
  evaluation. We provide experimental results obtained in simulation for swarms of
  over 10,000 robots.

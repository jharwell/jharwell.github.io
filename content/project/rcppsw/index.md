This is a collection of reusable, general purpose C++ code that I have built up
over the years, and that I update as I have time, implementing various data
structures, algorithms, abstractions as I need to. One of the challenges of
creating/maintaining a C++ library is that there are so many other libraries out
there like Boost, that I have to strike a balance between building something
from scratch, because I don’t want to try and figure out how to use another
library, and rolling my own version because I don’t need the industrial strength
version.

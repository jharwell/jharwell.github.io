This was my first major woodworking project in our first house, and was
challenging because:

- I didn't have a table saw
- I had a rudimentary circular saw guide for cutting long straight lines

Nevertheless, once everything was assembled, it was square! At least by my
measure of "does it wobble when you nudge it". Drawers were functional, if a bit
rough.

I ended up having to sand each drawer a bit and try to pull the slots straight with clamping and more screws, and got pretty close to fully square. |

# Lessons Learned

## Measuring and Cutting

- Make sure to account for the width of the workbench legs (if applicable) when
  measuring for the top of the workbench. I didn't, so now I have a 1.5" gap
  between the workbench top and the wall in the back.

- I free ripped all of the 2x4s, which was totally unecessary: I could have used
  my 7" speed square as a handy straightedge guide (assuming the 2x4s were cut
  squarely, that is).

## Drawers

- Drawers are hard.

- Unlike other things in woodworking, you want at _least_ a 1/8" tolerance
  between the size of the drawers and the size of the slot the drawers will
  slide into. I didn't do this, and ended up having to uniquely sand the sides
  and top of the completed drawers to fit into individual slots.

- It is really important that the slots you will be sliding the drawers into are
  square, especially when it comes to the dividers that dilineate the slots. I
  didn't do this, so things were _approximately_ square, but not quite. What I
  _should_ have done was draw lines the exact width of the dividers on the top
  and bottom of the drawer slots where the dividers were supposed to go, and
  make sure the dividers _exactly_ fit there.

- Clamp _everything_ tightly before drilling, and keep everything clamped while
  screwing.

- Make sure you account for the width of the drawer sides when cutting the
  bottom. I didn't, so I had to re-cut the drawer sides.

# Staining

- Staining is not like painting--if you use a brush, you put a LITTLE bit on the
  brush at a time, and go over the same area multiple times until you get the
  desired coverage. If you go too thick too quick, the wood can get stained
  opaquely and look bad, plus you have lots of drips.

abstract: The exploration time for a swarm of robots doing object gathering depends
  on the specific task, environment, number of objects, and number of robots. Hence,
  it is important to understand how different properties affect the exploration time.
  To address this practical challenge, we present a theoretical analysis of the expected
  exploration time for a swarm of robots that are searching for objects in an arena
  and present experimental results obtained with different swarm sizes. The experimental
  results are consistent with the theoretical analysis.

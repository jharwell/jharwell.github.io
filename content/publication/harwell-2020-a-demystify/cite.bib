 abstract = {We investigate the emergence of swarm intelligence using task allocation in large
robot swarms. First, we compare task decomposition graphs of different levels of richness
and measure the emergent intelligence arising from self-organized task allocation
by deriving STOCH-N1, a stochastic allocation algorithm which contextualizes per-robot
task allocation decisions based on a previous task's neighborhood within the graph.
The results are compared to other state of the art algorithms. Second, we derive MAT-OPT:
a greedy algorithm that optimally solves the swarm task allocation problem by representing
the swarm's task allocation space as a matroid under some restrictive assumptions.
We compare the MAT-OPT allocation method, which disregards task dependencies, with
STOCH-N1, which emphasizes collective learning of graph structure (including dependencies).
Results from an object gathering task show that swarm emergent intelligence (1) is
sensitive to the richness of task decomposition graphs (2) is positively correlated
with performance, (3) arises out of learning and exploitation of graph connectivity
and structure, rather than graph content.},

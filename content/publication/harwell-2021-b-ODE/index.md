abstract: 'We study the limits of linear modeling of swarm
behavior by characterizing the inflection point beyond which
linear models of swarm collective behavior break down. The
problem we consider is a central place object gathering task.
We design a linear model which strives to capture the un-
derlying dynamics of object gathering in robot swarms from
first principles, rather than extensively relying on post-hoc
model fitting. We evaluate our model with swarms of up to
8,000 robots in simulation, demonstrating that it accurately
captures underlying swarm behavioral dynamics when the
swarm can be approximated using the mean-field model, and
when it cannot, and finite-size effects are present. We further
apply our model to swarms exhibiting non-linear behaviors,
and show that it still provides accurate predictions in some
scenarios, thereby establishing better practical limits on lin-
ear modeling of swarm behaviors.'

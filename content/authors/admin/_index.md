Dr. Harwell is an experienced emebedded systems engineer researcher specializing
in multi-agent systems and robotics. His embedded experience spans many
different types of hardware: custom spacecraft avionics, commercial chips such
as ARM Cortex-M7, as well as custom SoCs. He has extensive experience
architecting, building, and debugging software in embedded systems, from
bare-metal to RTOS to embedded Linux, programming in C,C++, and assembly. He is
strongly committed to bringing elements of software engineering into research
and development in order to accelerate progress and reproducibility through
automation and better tooling.

His research interests lie in the investigation of behavior in interacting
multi-agent systems, at the intersection of task allocation, mathematical
modeling, complexity theory, robotics, and swarm intelligence. Broadly:

- Understanding the fundamental principles of large systems, including the
  “unpredictable” behaviors which emerge as systems interact with their
  environments in non-trivial ways, to develop better models of collective
  behavior.

- Developing mathematical models for predictive control of large-scale
  multi-agent systems from first principles which are robust enough to cross the
  simulation-reality gap. Of particular interest are applications in dangerous
  or unstable environments (e.g., mining, space exploration), or dynamic
  environments (i.e., those which are modified by the system as it operates),
  such as agriculture, autonomous construction, debris/waste removal.

His PhD thesis is [here]({{<ref "publication/harwell-2022-b-thesis">}}).

<!-- His PhD thesis developed new theoretical -->
<!-- tools for measuring, modeling, controlling, and (critically) predicting the -->
<!-- behavior of bio-inspired multi-agent systems from small (≤ 5 agents) to large (≥ -->
<!-- 10, 000 agents across scales, and targeted applications to foraging and -->
<!-- construction tasks in dynamic, dangerous, and unknown environments. -->

<!-- More specifically: -->

<!-- 1. Behavioral modeling and analysis: Modeling explicit and implicit information -->
<!--    flow in multi-agent systems, information latency. Prediction of collective -->
<!--    behavior from first principles on non-trivial problems such as foraging, for -->
<!--    both memory-less agents and agents with finite memory (forward -->
<!--    problem). Deriving agent controllers to obtain a desired collective behavior -->
<!--    (inverse problem). -->

<!-- 2. Self-healing systems: Mitigation of malfunctioning sensors/actuators, -->
<!--    autonomous convergence recognition. Robust anomaly recognition: -->
<!--    task-independent identification of misbehaving individuals in the presence of -->
<!--    dynamic workloads. Rebalancing task distributions after handling anomalies or -->
<!--    whet tasks change/new tasks are dynamically introduced. -->

<!-- 3. Engineering better multi-agent systems: How to create insightful measurements -->
<!--    of measurements of system behavior such as self-organization, scalability, -->
<!--    convergence, robustness, etc., and how these can be made prescriptive so they -->
<!--    can be used in automated design methods. -->

<!-- 4. Long-term multi-robot system autonomy: How to increase the ability of these -->
<!--    systems to operate for long periods of time without/with minimal human -->
<!--    intervention or supervision. Optimal foraging theory, control barrier -->
<!--    function approaches, optimization of battery usage under uncertainty. -->

In this project, I followed the general design from
[here](https://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/small-pallet-inspired-coat-rack-shelves/),
expanding the size of the coatrack so that it extended along most of the space
in one side of the mudroom. Now, instead of only 5-6 coat hooks are scrunched
together and no cubby/shelf storage for hats/mittens/etc, we have 24 coat hooks
and copious amounts of cubby/shelf storage!

# Lessons Learned

## Materials

- When you go to a lumberyard at a place like Menards and get a board out of the
  8' section, take a measuring tape and make sure it is actually 8'. The 2x6
  board I chose for the bottom of the coatrack was ~2.5" short, so I ended up
  having to modify my design to accomodate that. Not a showstopper, but still
  irritating.

- When you go to a lumberyard, check all of the boards you choose for structural
  cracks, bowedness--don't just _assume_ that all of the boards are
  "good". FWIW, Menard's seems to have MUCH better lumber than either Home Depot
  or Lowe's, and least near me. I didn't do this for the coatrack, and ended up
  with some boards which were noticeably bowed. I was able to mostly--but not
  entirely--work around this with clamping as I went along, so the file product
  was not quite as true as I would have liked. Even so, unless you _know_ where
  the bowedness is, it's not so bad imo that your eye is drawn to it.

## Building

- Check for square at each and every step, because it is easier to correct it on
  the piece you just added than when you get 90% of the way done and realize
  some aspect of the project is _just_ not square enough to be a problem. This
  happened with one of the vertical end pieces.

- When joining boards in a "T"; that is, drilling through the face of board #1
  into the edge of board #2 for e.g., a shelf, mark the _exact_ thickness of
  board #2 on both faces of board #1 where it is supposed to goa. This ensures
  that:

    - You clamp the board exactly in the desired position so that after adding
      screws and removing clamps the board ends up where you intended.

    - When drilling into board #2, you don't drill too close to the surface of
      it. If board #2 is for e.g., a shelf, then this can result in the screw
      beginning to split the wood as weight is applied to the shelf as you put
      stuff on it.

  Both of these happened with the upper shelf of the coatrack, and I had to
  re-clamp and and some more screws to try and get the board into the correct
  position, which was made more difficult because the shelf board I had bought
  was bowed into a subtle "smile" as you sighted down the length of the board.

- When trying to get large projects square, if you need to clamp something
  larger than the biggest clamp you have, tow straps work GREAT! I discovered
  this by accident on the [Garaga Shelves]({{<ref "project/garage-shelves">}})
  project, and it was invaluable to try to square this project as well.

## Staining

- You can't trust that the samples they have at the hardware store showing how a
  stain will look on this wood or that are accurate--who knows how long they've
  been sitting there!

- You also can't trust the color they show on the can, because that's just
  marketing, and is probably an artificially created image--not a picture of
  that particular stain actually being applied to anything.

- The only thing you _can_ trust is doing what the instructions on the can say:
  test a little of the stain on a small inconspicuous area, let dry, and see
  what you think. I did _NOT_ do this for the coat rack, and stain the whole
  thing "Caberet", which as you might imagine, turned out rather, well,
  _caberet_-esque--a nice PURPLE wine color.

In the store, the Caberet color looked a nice deep reddish-brown, which was what
was on the can too.  Needless to say, after the initial staining, both my wife
and I agreed that the color was awful, and so I had to spend like 5 hours with
the sander removing it before staining it a more reasonable color.

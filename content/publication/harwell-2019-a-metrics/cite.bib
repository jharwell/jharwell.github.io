 abstract = {When designing swarm-robotic systems, systematic comparison of algorithms from
different domains is necessary to determine which is capable of scaling up to
handle the target problem size and target operating conditions. We propose a set of
quantitative metrics for scalability, flexibility, and emergence which are capable
of addressing these needs during the system design process. We demonstrate the
applicability of our proposed metrics as a design tool by solving a large object
gathering problem in temporally varying operating conditions using iterative
hypothesis evaluation. We provide experimental results obtained in simulation for
swarms of over 10,000 robots.},
